Neural networks are machine learning models inspired by the structure of the human brain.
They are composed of layers of interconnected nodes called neurons. Each neuron receives
inputs, applies a weighted sum, and then passes the result through a nonlinear activation
function such as ReLU or sigmoid.

A neural network typically includes three types of layers: an input layer, one or more
hidden layers, and an output layer. The power of neural networks comes from the depth
and number of hidden layers, allowing them to learn complex nonlinear functions.

Training a neural network involves adjusting weights using backpropagation and gradient
descent. The loss function measures the difference between the model’s predictions and
the true values. Reducing the loss improves the accuracy of the model.

Neural networks are widely used in image classification, natural language processing,
medical diagnosis, and robotics. Deep learning, which refers to neural networks with
many layers, has enabled breakthroughs such as large language models and systems like AlphaGo.
