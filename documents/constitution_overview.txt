The United States Constitution was written in 1787 during the Philadelphia Convention.
It established the framework for the federal government and replaced the Articles of
Confederation, which had proven ineffective.

The Constitution begins with the Preamble, which states the goals of the new government,
including forming a more perfect union and securing the blessings of liberty. The main
body consists of seven articles describing the structure of government.

Article I establishes the legislative branch, Congress, which is divided into the House
of Representatives and the Senate. Article II establishes the executive branch led by the
President. Article III establishes the judicial branch, including the Supreme Court.

To protect individual rights, the Bill of Rights was introduced in 1791. These first ten
amendments guarantee key freedoms such as speech, religion, and due process of law.

The Constitution remains the highest law of the United States and has been amended 27
times to reflect social and political change.
