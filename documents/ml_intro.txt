Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems
that learn from data. Rather than being explicitly programmed, machine learning models
identify patterns within datasets and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions.

There are three major categories of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised
learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled datasets, meaning
that each example includes the correct output. A common supervised learning example is
predicting house prices based on features like size and location.

Unsupervised learning uses data without explicit labels. The goal is to discover underlying
structures such as clusters or associations. A popular algorithm is K-means clustering.

Reinforcement learning is based on agents interacting with an environment and receiving
rewards or penalties. Over time the agent learns which actions maximize reward.

Machine learning is used in many real-world applications such as recommendation systems,
fraud detection, self-driving vehicles, and speech recognition. As data continues to grow,
machine learning has become essential to modern technology.
